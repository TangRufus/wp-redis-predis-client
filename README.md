# WP Redis - Predis Client

This is a package that enables the use of Predis as a Redis Client as opposed to PHPRedis. Predis has the advantage of connecting to Redis via TLS.

TODO: I need to create an intermediate object that mimic's PHPRedis' method signatures to ensure WP Redis continues to operate as normal.
